# **CODESOFT - Data Science Internship Portfolio**

Hey there! Welcome to my portfolio—your peek into the projects that shaped my journey as a Data Science Intern at Codsoft. This collection highlights the challenges I tackled and the creative solutions I built using data analysis and machine learning. Here’s their Quick View:

#### **1. Movie Rating Prediction with Python**  
Ever wondered how movie ratings are determined? In this project, I created a system to predict them using Python.  
- The process included gathering and cleaning data, exploring trends, and building a machine learning model to make accurate predictions.  
- I also dived into visualization to make sense of the patterns behind the ratings.

#### **2. Iris Flower Classification**  
A classic machine learning experiment, this project involved classifying iris flowers based on their sepal and petal dimensions.  
- I worked with the Iris dataset to train models like Decision Trees and K-Nearest Neighbors.  
- It was fascinating to see how small measurements could unlock the diversity of flower species.  

#### **3. Sales Prediction using Python**  
Every business loves to forecast its future sales—and I built a predictive model for that!  
- I analyzed historical data, identified trends, and engineered features to improve predictions.  
- The outcome? A system that pinpoints sales patterns and aids better business decisions.  

#### **4. Credit Card Fraud Detection**  
Fraudulent transactions are a massive challenge, but I developed a model to flag them efficiently.  
- Tackled the imbalance between fraud and genuine cases using techniques like SMOTE.  
- Focused on metrics like Precision and Recall to ensure the model wasn’t just accurate but practical for real-world use.

#### **5. Skills & Extra Highlights**  
While working on these projects, I honed some valuable skills:  
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation:** Turning messy, raw data into structured datasets ready for analysis.  
- **Visualization:** Using tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn to create clear, impactful visuals.  
- **Machine Learning Experimentation:** Continuously testing algorithms and tuning models for the best results.  
- **Collaboration Tools:** Staying organized with GitHub and version control while juggling multiple tasks.
